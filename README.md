This is a project that builds an LLM powered English-to English dictionary app. The code generates the apk file that can be installed on an Android phone.
When a word or a phrase or an idiom is enetered, the dictionary explains the meaning in simple English, gives synonyms and antonyms if possible and two example
sentences to further clarify the usage. 
It requires an api-key of an LLM like OpenAI model.
